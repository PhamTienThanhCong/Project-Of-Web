### Construction method

It will include 3 main steps:

1, Input data processing:
  - Get data from input tháº» tag
  - Randomly generate data without input
  - you can view it at: https://github.com/phamtienthanhcong/Project-Of-Web/blob/master/heapSort/function/input.js
  
2, Process data for each case
  - Since JavaScript will prioritize running some processes first, we won't be able to generate descriptions in its for loops.
  - So I created an intermediate array that stores the results after each run of the process.
  - And those variables can contain the values of the array, the state of each element of the array (edit, delete, correct), position or comment,...

3, Show on the screen each run
  - After having the data returned from the data processing function. I proceeded to show each part with time using `setInterval()`
  - Inside of `setInterval()` you can use any way to display your data. For me, I prefer `HTML Canvas Graphics` because it's easy to use and implement
